                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I'm a web developer living in Italy, where I work as a freelance developer. 
                    I've always been drawn to the overlap between front end & back end development. 
                    My strength lies in creating User Experience & interactivity, 
                    however, I enjoy both aspect and love building websites from start to finish, for clients all over the world.</p>
                <p>If you wanna get in touch, talk to me about a project collaboration or just say hi, feel free to contact me on Hianthonylan@gmail.com and ~let's talk.</p>
